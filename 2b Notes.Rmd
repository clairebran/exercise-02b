# Some notes from class on Wednesday, January 24th

## You can choose different ways to display the html output of code chunks in RMarkdown

eval evaluates (or doesn't evaluate) the code chunk\
here is eval = TRUE, which shows the code and the output 
```{r eval=TRUE}
2 + 2
```
here is eval = FALSE, this puts the code chunk in the html file but not the output
```{r eval=FALSE}
2 + 2
```
here is echo = FALSE, this shows the output but not the code chunk
```{r echo=FALSE}
2 + 2
```
